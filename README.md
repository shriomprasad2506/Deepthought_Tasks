# Project Overview
This project encompasses two tasks completed during my internship assignment to evaluate my capabilities:

## Task 1: Event Management Backend
A web application that allows users to create, view, update, and delete events through a user-friendly interface, supporting essential CRUD operations.

## Task 2: API Documentation for Nudge API
Comprehensive documentation detailing endpoint information, request/response structures, and example use cases to enhance accessibility and usability.

These tasks collectively demonstrate my skills in backend development and technical documentation.
